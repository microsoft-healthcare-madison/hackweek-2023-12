For question 2, is there an existing set of LOINC codes that can be used to represent the data?  
If so, please provide the JSON of the FHIR Questionnaire Item as Coding options with their LOINC codes.
If there is not a good match and there is not an Unknown code, do not invent one - label that data with a code of NotFound.
