/**
 * Data Abstraction Instructions:
 * 
 * The task of the data abstraction team is to read chunks of EHR text and translate
 * relevant clinical information into structured facts, following the FactModel interface.
 * The team should follow these guidelines:
 * 
 * 1. Identifying relevant information:
 *    - Focus on extracting information that maps to the fields in the
 *      SoftTissueBiopsyHistoClinicalInformationFact interface.
 *    - Search for key phrases that typically introduce relevant data such as:
 *      "Clinical presentation", "Spread", "Previous relevant pathology",
 *      "Radiology", and "Clinical finding".
 * 
 * 2. Determining when to create facts and when to discard irrelevant data:
 *    - Create a new fact (an instance of FactModel) when you encounter data
 *      that fits into the SoftTissueBiopsyHistoClinicalInformationFact structure.
 *    - Discard data that doesn't seem to provide information relevant to the
 *      fields defined in the interface. For example, administrative data such as
 *      room numbers or scheduling details do not belong to the fact model.
 * 
 * 3. Handling missing information:
 *    - All elements in the interfaces are optional to account for the possibility
 *      that some information may be missing from the EHR data.
 *    - If an expected piece of data is not present in the EHR chunk, leave the
 *      corresponding field undefined in the created FactModel instance.
 * 
 * 4. Recording dates:
 *    - Whenever a date is mentioned in the context of a fact, record it.
 *      Dates are crucial for downstream summarization and analysis.
 *    - Ensure that the date is recorded in ISO 8601 format or use the JavaScript
 *      Date object.
 * 
 * 5. Aggregation:
 *    - As the data will be aggregated, ensure that each fact is recorded
 *      separately, and the array of FactModel should contain discrete
 *      elements for each fact.
 *    - Do not include patient identification in the facts, as this process
 *      assumes abstraction for a single patient context.
 * 
 * The data abstraction team should repeatedly apply these instructions to
 * each chunk of EHR data they process, outputting an array of FactModel
 * instances that represent the extracted information.

This TypeScript code block defines a `FactModel` interface that the data abstraction team should use to structure the clinical information extracted from EHR data chunks for soft tissue biopsy histopathology. The interfaces are designed to capture relevant clinical data points, and the commentary provides detailed instructions for identifying pertinent information, determining when to create facts, how to deal with missing data, the importance of accurate date recording, and how to handle the aggregation of the facts.
